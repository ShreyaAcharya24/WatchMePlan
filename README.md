## 📍 Overview

**WatchMePlan** is a centralized **event management platform** designed for both **Event Organizers** and **Attendees**. Think of it as a **BookMyShow**, but tailored for **local events** — including cultural shows, college fests, exhibitions, and community meetups.

This project was inspired by a real-world gap in how local events are marketed and managed.

## 💡 Problem It Solves

The traditional system of promoting and managing events is fragmented and inefficient.
**WatchMePlan** addresses key pain points:

- ❌ Events are often missed by potential attendees due to lack of exposure.
- ❌ Organizers struggle with expensive or ineffective marketing.
- ❌ Unfair ticket pricing and lack of transparency.
- ❌ Cumbersome registration and booking process.
- ❌ No centralized portal for local events.

**WatchMePlan** solves this by offering a digital, streamlined solution for both parties.
